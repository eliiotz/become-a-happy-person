## Draft

How many of you believe that, there is a soul. Please raise your hand.

(wait for a while) 

Thank you. Today my topic is "arguments for the existence of the soul". At the very beginning of this speech, I want to clarify what do I mean by saying "soul" here. I am on the stage. You can see it. But you can only see my body. Am I equal to my body? Suppose that there is a part of me different from my body, we can call it a soul. Me, but not my body. Or we may say, my soul refers to any part of me beyond my body.

Then, is there anything beyond my body. I believe that my body exists, because I can see it, I can touch and hear it, I can smell it, or even taste it. My belief is based on my senses. But the soul is different. I can't sense my soul. There are some people saying that they have sensed the soul, but never proved to be stable. So the soul is different, I can't sense it directly. then how about gravity. We believe in the existence of gravity, right? but we can't sense it directly too. I can jump, and then fall back to the ground. I can see the movement of my body, but I can't see gravity, a "gravity". So why do I believe that there is gravity. I believe in the gravity, because, supposed that there is no gravity, I can't explain why I will fall back to the ground. Why I haven't stayed in the mid air. In 1 word, we can't explain the reality without the existence of gravity. 

So, the question changed. the initial question, "is there a soul", turned into "can we explain the reality if there is nothing beyond my body". What can the "reality" be here? To make the arguments simpler, let me just give a candidate. Let's talk about, love.  We all agree that there is love, right? And we believe that love is special. Love leads to some, body reactions. When I fall in love with a girl, my heart will beat fast when I get close to her. But is love equal to the body reactions? What if we put a machine on my arm, giving me a injection once I get close to the table. So every time when I get close the table, my heart will beat fast because of the injection. Do I love the table? Body reactions! Of course, love leads to a very complicated combination of body reactions. Look at her and smile, run and hug. But suppose, suppose that we have carefully copied, replayed all those body reactions, is it love? How many of you think this is love. If it is not love, if love is not only a sort of body reactions, there must be something beyond my body to explain the existence of love. There must be a soul.

Let me reclarify it. A pure body can only make body reactions. That's why we call it "body reactions", right? If my love is not only a sort of body reactions, it means that my love is not only made by my body, but also something different from my body. Or we may say, beyond our body. Something beyond my body make a sort of body reactions love. Now, according to our definition in the beginning, what is this "something"? It's a soul!

So the theory of soul explained the existence of love. If there is no soul, we have to give another explanation. We can explain body reactions, electronic signals in our brain, nerves, muscles, heartbeat. But how do those body reactions, those electronic signals in our brain, become love. Can anyone of you give such an explanation? If you can't give such an explanation, does it mean that, we have to admit the existence of the soul?

Let's go back to the example of gravity. Let's go back to the ages when the theory of gravity has not been found. Let's find Newton and say, "hey, do you know why the apple fall to the ground? It's because of the love from the earth. She loves the apple so much, that she keeps pulling the apple with some invisible hands." Will he believe me? believe in the existence of love from the earth? I don't think so. Or he wouldn't find gravity. there must be similar theories in real history. He won't believe it because, although he doesn't know a pure physical explanation for now, he believes that there should be one. And that theory will be better. An explanation is not enough. It has to be the "best possible" explanation. 

Now, for those who believe in the soul, they may say, "It is the soul that makes love love". for those who still believe that there is no soul, they may feel free to say, "Right, we don't have a physical explanation for love now. But there will be one. The best possible explanation will be physical".

Let's end the arguments here. I won't give you a standard answer; And maybe there is no standard answer. The key of this topic is not the "soul", but the "arguments". "What", "why", "how", we started from a question, continued with questions, and ended with even more questions. Actually there are some flaws in this speech; I'd be glad if we may discuss them after the meeting. Believe everything believable, question everything questionable, to reach every truth reachable. This is the spirit of philosophy, this is the spirit of science. Thank you.
